                "Yellowstone Cabin Rental On Private Acreage Five Miles From The Park's North Gate And Best Wildlife Watching And Cutthroat Trout Fishing! \
                    Charming cabin built in 2009 with two bedrooms that sleeps 5-6 located just five minutes from Yellowstone Park's North Entrance on 26 acres of private property. Perfect for travelers who want easy access to the famous Northern Range and Lamar Valley with its bison, elk, deer, wolves, bears, AND fishing for world-famous Yellowstone cutthroat trout! \
                    This beautiful cabin is unlike all other vacation rental properties in the area. Lying in an extremely private location just above Highway 89 north of Gardiner, Montana, and the Roosevelt Arch, the cabin is easily accessed by a well-maintained, short, 300 yard-long Private Drive. \
                    This setting provides you with total solitude and isolation from any hustle and bustle of the busy roadways leading to/from the park. However, at the same time, when needed, you are just minutes away from restaurants, the market, and shops in Gardiner or a bit further away in Livingston and Bozeman. \
                    Built on a log frame, this cabin has all modern amenities yet has a great amount of rustic appeal including beautiful hardwood floors.  It has enormous windows giving you unmatched views of Yellowstone's Electric Peak, Devil's Slide, Dome Mountain, and many other spectacular geological features.  Wildlife abound here and deer, elk, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, or bison are seen on the meadows and mountain slopes near the cabin. Often during the spring and fall, they are standing right in the cabin's yard. No-where else in the northern Rockies will you find wildlife this abundant and close in a natural setting. \
                    Horses graze nearby, and the Yellowstone River, home to world-class trout fishing, leaves the park and passes just a few hundred yards below you. \
                    There are many access sites to the Yellowstone River very near to the cabin, one within easy walking distance (that is a very great fishing spot...just ask our boys!). \
                    Being near Gardiner, our cabin is at the home of the Yellowstone Association, a long-standing educational institute offering numerous courses in the park. The Electric Peak Cabin is a perfect place to stay when visiting and attending these courses.",
